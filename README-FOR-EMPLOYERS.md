# Steven Jenkins-Edwards: Final Capstone for Tech Elevator: Philadelphia Pothole Tracker

Tech Elevator assigned my group (myself along with Dennis Angelisanti, Jessica Larson and Cindy Li) this project as our final capstone. We were to implement what we learned from the past fourteen weeks and use it to build a fully-functioning website using Vue.js for the frontend and Java/PostgreSQL for the backend/database.

I've begun modifying the initial project; I'll keep a list of changes here.
